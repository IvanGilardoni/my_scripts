    "Recompute the average potential energies (column 3) as done in day 2 (for different temperatures from 0 to 3), together with the corresponding error on the mean estimated by the standard deviation (divided by square root of n. of samples) $\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}$. Remember to discard initial steps due to equilibration.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hint: focus firstly on the energies at a given temperature and perform block analysis by varying the block size (in logarithmic scale); plot the error as a function of the block size. What happens starting from block size = 1 and increasing it? Search for a plateau region, which identifies the optimal block size. Then, use this block size for all the temperatures (assumption); plot both $\\sigma_{\\overline{x}}$ and the error estimated with block analysis as a function of the temperature.\n",
